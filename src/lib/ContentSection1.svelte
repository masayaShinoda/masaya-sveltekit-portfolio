            <h2>My Design Philosphy</h2>
            <p>In this busy world, we tend to overlook how important it is to keep things simple. My approach in creating websites and infographics is to deliver essential information in an easy-to-digest manner.</p>
            <p>I consciously make an effort to make website navigations to be intuitive and accessible. Accessibility is a <span class="font__bold">necessity</span>, not an afterthought.</p>
